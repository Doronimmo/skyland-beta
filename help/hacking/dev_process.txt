 When developing new levels
 for SKYLAND, I actually build
 the enemies on the GBA
 itself.

 I usually open up the battle
 sandbox, create the enemy,
 and then, in a uart console
 (see /help/uart.txt),
 run (rooms (opponent)) and
 then (chrs (opponent)),
 and copy paste the result
 from the terminal window
 into a local file.

 I didn't bother to create a
 level editor for skyland.

 The gameboy is the level
 editor!

 Sometimes, on long trips, I
 don't have a laptop or a
 uart->gba cable handy. In 
 those cases, I basically
 just open up an onscreen
 repl, and run
 (log (rooms (opponent))),
 followed by (log-flush).

 I would then go into log.txt
 in sram, copy the data with
 the skyland text editor, and
 paste it into another file.
 Or, if I was planning on
 creating multiple levels,
 I wouldn't bother to flush
 the log each time,
 I'd just create a
 few levels, log each one,
 and finally, flush the log,
 and turn of the gba.

 Basically, I'm just writing
 this for posterity, in case
 someday anyone is interested
 in my process. I did indeed
 develop the levels for
 skyland on my gameboy :)
