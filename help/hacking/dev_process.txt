 When developing new levels
 for SKYLAND, I actually build
 the enemies on the GBA
 itself.

 I never bothered to make a
 level editor for SKYLAND. I
 simply open up the sandbox,
 connect a uart console, and
 run (rooms (opponent)) to
 fetch a lisp representation
 of the enemy castle.

 Sometimes, when away from a
 computer, I would open up
 a repl in the sandbox editor,
 and run
 (log (rooms (opponent)))
 followed by (log-flush) to
 store the level data in the
 system log.

 But generally, yeah, I make
 the levels on a gameboy!
