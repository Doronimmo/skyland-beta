The source code for SKYLAND
is available under the terms
of the GPL license. If you're
simply modding the game, this
should not be a problem, as
the game's scripts are
appended to the rom in plain
text.

While the code is open source,
the game's art assets are
technically proprietary. That
said, I'm a busy person, and
I don't have the time or the
interest to go after people
making mods. In fact I
encourage modding. Just
don't sell copies of the game
and you're fine.
