For anyone who wants to
translate the game. Skyland
natively supports unicode,
and ships with all of the
glyphs required for english,
spanish, french, italian,
russian, ukrainian,
japanese, and a subset of
2500 of the most common
chinese words.

To begin localization,
first you'll need to
unpack the rom. You may use
the python script included
in the tools directory for
rom unpacking.

Next, you'll need to add
a new entry in
strings/lang.txt, to map
the utf8 language name to
an ascii skyland filesystem
path. See lang.txt for
examples. Just add a new
line following the existing
format.

Create a file containing
the translated text, by
copy-pasting strings.txt
and translating each line.
The entry you created in
lang.txt should of course
refer to the name of your
new transation file.

Now comes the tricky part.
There are tons of strings
embedded in all of the game's
lisp level scripts. But
the engine binds the language
file at startup to a lisp
variable called lang,
so technically you could
localize the text in the lisp
scripts by moving the dialog
strings to the language files
and calling the lisp builtin
get-line-of-file with the
language file path as a
parameter.

All of the tools for
localizing the game should
already exist, without
needing to disassemble the
game or mess with the C++
code.
