## Code Quality

I originally built Skyland in 20 days for a game jam, and a few parts of the code are
a bit rough.


## Building

1) Install all of the standard devkitpro libgba stuff.
2) Install cmake
3) `cd build && ./set-gameboy-advance-toolchain.sh` (a shortcut for running cmake with the correct toolchain file)
4) run ./build.sh
