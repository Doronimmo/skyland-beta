During the early years of sky

civilization, the Sylph

maintained strict isolation.

They watched from higher

altitudes as waves of refugees

fled upward from the surface.

Rather than intervene

directly, they observed and

documented, believing it

crucial to maintain their

cultural purity during this

chaotic period.

This earned them a reputation

as distant and aloof among

other sky peoples.
