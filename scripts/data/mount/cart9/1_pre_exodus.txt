The Sylph began as a

civilization of mountain

dwellers, living in

high-altitude cities nestled

in the world's tallest peaks.


Their isolation and altitude

led them to develop unique

technologies for surviving in

low-oxygen environments. They

were known for their

observatories and weather

prediction capabilities, as

their mountaintop positions

gave them unparalleled views

of the sky.
