Unlike the chaotic mass exodus

that brought most humans to

the sky, the Sylph's journey

upward was calculated and

prepared. They had already

developed early antigravity

technology through their study

of crystal formations in their

mountain homes. When signs of

surface degradation became

evident, they methodically

lifted their entire cities

into the sky, bringing their

culture and knowledge intact.
