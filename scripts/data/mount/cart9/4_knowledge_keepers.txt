Current Sylph society is

structured around the

preservation and advancement

of knowledge.

Their cities serve as vast

archives of pre-catastrophe

information, though they are

selective about what they

share with outsiders.

They maintain their own

writing system not out of

secrecy, but as a link to

their ancient mountain

culture.
