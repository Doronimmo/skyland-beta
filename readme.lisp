; You may edit any files in
; the sram filesystem. If
; you manage to break stuff,
; simply delete a file, and
; the game will restore a
; cached copy from the rom.

; You may also edit files in
; rom! The game will create a
; copy of the edited file in
; sram, and load the sram file
; instead. All files in sram
; will be loaded
; preferentially, so
; creating an sram file can
; effectively override a rom
; file with the same path.
; Recommendation: if you're
; just getting started, try
; playing around with the
; files in
; /rom/scripts/config/

; One final note: the game
; will not run custom code
; during multiplayer mode.
; SRAM files will be
; entirely ignored during
; multiplayer games.
