Some merchants broadcast an advertisement for advanced technology! Let's see if they have anything useful!
<c:merchant:7> We ordered too many

what do you say?
<c:merchant:7> Seems like you have enough now!
<c:merchant:7> Sorry, that's not enough! Do you want to salvage some stuff to come up with the resources for payment? I'll check back in in 15 seconds?
<c:merchant:7> Looks great! You made a fine choice!
