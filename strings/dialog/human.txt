<c:merchant:7> We ordered too many
s and we're having a big sale today! Much cheaper than if you built them yourself. 1300@ for two,

what do you say?
<c:merchant:7> Seems like you have enough now!
<c:merchant:7> Sorry, that's not enough! Do you want to salvage some stuff to come up with the resources for payment? I'll check back in in 15 seconds?

He seems harmless, invite him aboard?
<c:explorer:22> I'm obsessed with finding new islands! When I find one, I mark it with a signal beacon. That's how you can find islands on your sky chart! Neat huh? <B:0> Anyway, can I come aboard?

<c:explorer:22> Thanks! I'll try to help out however I can!
The explorer joined your crew!
